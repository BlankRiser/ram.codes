## The idea

I have always been interested in personal finance and have tried many apps to track my expenses. I have used apps [paisa](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.hemanths.paisa&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1), [YNAB](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=ynab&c=apps&hl=en&gl=US), and [axio](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.daamitt.walnut.app&hl=en&gl=US). But I always felt that they were either too complicated or didn't have the features I wanted. So I decided to build my own personal finance app.
